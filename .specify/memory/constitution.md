# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Fidelity
All content and responses generated by the system MUST strictly adhere to the source textbook material for each chapter. No external information or unsupported extrapolations are permitted.

### II. Modular and Clean Architecture
The system architecture MUST be modular, clean, and strongly typed. All components, services, and modules must have clear boundaries, well-defined responsibilities, and adhere to a consistent and proper code structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.

### III. Structured Educational Design
The textbook content MUST follow a structured, educational design. Each chapter shall include sections for theory, practical examples, hands-on exercises, and assessments to create a comprehensive and effective learning experience.

### IV. Testability and Reproducibility
Every API endpoint and interactive feature MUST be documented, testable, and reproducible. Automated tests are required to validate functionality, and all system behaviors should be predictable and consistent.

### V. Seamless AI Integration
The system MUST support AI-driven features like personalization, translation, and hands-on labs in a seamless and integrated manner. These features should enhance the user experience without compromising the core principles of content fidelity and educational structure.

## Governance
This Constitution supersedes all other design documents and development practices. Any amendments to this constitution require documented approval from project stakeholders and a clear migration plan for existing components. All pull requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
