## Prompt

its not detail

## Response snapshot

I have updated the file `frontend/docs/module-4/3-cognitive-planning.md` with a more detailed explanation. I will now create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Further detailed a documentation file based on user feedback.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a documentation change.
- 📁 Files: Modified one markdown file.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting further feedback or new instructions from the user.
- 🧠 Reflection: User requested more detail, indicating the previous explanation was insufficient. Expanded significantly on technical aspects and examples.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None observed in this step.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Consider proactively asking for desired level of detail for documentation tasks.
