## Prompt

now for Bridging Python Agents to ROS 2 Controllers with rclpy

## Response snapshot

I have finished rewriting and translating the chapter on bridging Python agents to ROS 2. I will now create the Prompt History Record for this task.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Rewrote the 'Python-ROS Bridge' chapter to a professional, textbook-level standard, focusing on the Bridge architectural pattern. Translated it into Urdu and implemented a language toggle.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Overwrote one markdown file with new bilingual content and a Docusaurus Tabs component.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user confirmation or next instruction.
- 🧠 Reflection: This task followed the same successful pattern as the previous one. The detailed rewrite included a concrete code example of the bridge pattern, which should be very helpful for the reader. The process is now well-established.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None observed.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
