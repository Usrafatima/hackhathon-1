## Prompt

now Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for Humanoids

## Response snapshot

I have completed the detailed rewrite and translation for the "Understanding URDF for Humanoids" chapter. The file is now updated with the language toggle.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Rewrote the 'URDF for Humanoids' chapter to a professional, textbook-level standard, with a deep dive into links, joints, and the visual/collision/inertial tags. Translated it into Urdu and implemented a language toggle.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: Overwrote one markdown file with new bilingual content and a Docusaurus Tabs component.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user confirmation or next instruction.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process for rewriting and translating these chapters is now very smooth. I'm confident in the quality and detail of the new content. This chapter's rewrite, in particular, clarifies the often-confusing distinction between visual and collision geometries.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
